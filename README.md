# Community Hubs Network Board

Community Hubs Networks board is an small group of both team members and members from the community which they earned our trust. They'll handle
open-source code of conduct violations, has access to community moderation tools (across Telegram, GitHub/GitLab.com, Keybase, Discord and the Community Forum), and
have maintainership tools n our open-source projects.

## Board Members

We're looking for more members to help us handle code-of-conduct violations, enforce rules and moderate our Community Hubs, and voluntarily maintain our projects.
If you think you want to join us, [create a new issue](https://github.com/MadeByThePinsHub/Community-Hubs-Network-Board/issues).
